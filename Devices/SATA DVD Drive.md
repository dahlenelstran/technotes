Model Number: Super Multi DVD Writer GHCON
### Solved Problem: Plugged into computer with SATA to USB 3.0, power light on but no response
- Tried plugging into motherboard instead of USB hub, no change
- USB to SATA was only giving 5V instead of the needed 12V + 5V
- Plugged SATA Power from PSU, SATA Data to Motherboard, then worked
### Problem: Can only be used when plugged directly into PC
- Can purchase an Optical Drive Enclosure, or a powered SATA to USB adapter
